feature: no charge on with no battery
- add battery detection with Force IBAT discharge, add timer to check for measurement
- detect when battery is removed, and if no battery, check for battery every watchdog TO


feature: power conserve
- add support for all adc register read in a single transaction

feature: battery SoC
- on init, load battery state if present, else use 0/undefined
    - the first completed charging cycle complete will get the system to a well defined state
- change to continous ADC with averaging, from new value when discharging, calculate consumed energy based on IBAT and VBAT and elapsed time
- when charging, estimate battery percentage and wattage based on estimatating from charge phase
    - constant current => from VBAT (0-25%) linear function
    - constant voltage => from IBAT (25-100%) parabola function
- add userspace daemon that persists percentage into etc


feature: convenince
- charge enable property to charger (writable)
	- POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGE_ENABLED,
	- POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_BATTERY_CHARGING_ENABLED,
	- POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGING_ENABLED,

feature: misc
- determine better VSYSMIN value
- report battert technology (Add dts entry to battery + code prop get)
